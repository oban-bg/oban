  Migrations create and modify the database tables Oban needs to function.

  ## Usage

  To use migrations in your application you'll need to generate an `Ecto.Migration` that wraps
  calls to `Oban.Migration`:

  ```bash
  mix ecto.gen.migration add_oban
  ```

  Open the generated migration in your editor and call the `up` and `down` functions on
  `Oban.Migration`:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.AddOban do
    use Ecto.Migration

    def up, do: Oban.Migration.up()

    def down, do: Oban.Migration.down()
  end
  ```

  This will run all of Oban's versioned migrations for your database.

  Now, run the migration to create the table:

  ```bash
  mix ecto.migrate
  ```

  Migrations between versions are idempotent. As new versions are released, you may need to run
  additional migrations. To do this, generate a new migration:

  ```bash
  mix ecto.gen.migration upgrade_oban_to_v11
  ```

  Open the generated migration in your editor and call the `up` and `down` functions on
  `Oban.Migration`, passing a version number:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.UpgradeObanToV11 do
    use Ecto.Migration

    def up, do: Oban.Migration.up(version: 11)

    def down, do: Oban.Migration.down(version: 11)
  end
  ```

  ## Isolation with Prefixes

  Oban supports namespacing through PostgreSQL schemas, also called "prefixes" in Ecto. With
  prefixes your jobs table can reside outside of your primary schema (usually public) and you can
  have multiple separate job tables.

  To use a prefix you first have to specify it within your migration:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.AddPrefixedObanJobsTable do
    use Ecto.Migration

    def up, do: Oban.Migrations.up(prefix: "private")

    def down, do: Oban.Migrations.down(prefix: "private")
  end
  ```

  The migration will create the "private" schema and all tables, functions and triggers within
  that schema. With the database migrated you'll then specify the prefix in your configuration:

  ```elixir
  config :my_app, Oban,
    prefix: "private",
    ...
  ```

  In some cases, for example if your "private" schema already exists and your database user in
  production doesn't have permissions to create a new schema, trying to create the schema from the
  migration will result in an error. In such situations, it may be useful to inhibit the creation
  of the "private" schema:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.AddPrefixedObanJobsTable do
    use Ecto.Migration

    def up, do: Oban.Migrations.up(prefix: "private", create_schema: false)

    def down, do: Oban.Migrations.down(prefix: "private")
  end
  ```

  ## Migrating Without Ecto

  If your application uses something other than Ecto for migrations, be it an external system or
  another ORM, it may be helpful to create plain SQL migrations for Oban database schema changes.

  The simplest mechanism for obtaining the SQL changes is to create the migration locally and run
  `mix ecto.migrate --log-migrations-sql`. That will log all of the generated SQL, which you can
  then paste into your migration system of choice.

  Alternatively, if you'd like a more automated approach, try using the [oban_migations_sql][sql]
  project to generate `up` and `down` SQL migrations for you.
