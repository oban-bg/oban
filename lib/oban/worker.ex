defmodule Oban.Worker do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a behavior and macro to guide the creation of worker modules.

  Worker modules do the work of processing a job. At a minimum they must define a `perform/1`
  function, which will be called with an `args` map.

  ## Defining Workers

  Define a worker to process jobs in the `events` queue:

      defmodule MyApp.Workers.Business do
        use Oban.Worker, queue: "events", max_attempts: 10

        @impl true
        def perform(%Oban.Job{attempt: attempt}) when attempt > 3 do
          IO.inspect(attempt)
        end

        def perform(args) do
          IO.inspect(args)
        end
      end

  The `perform/1` function receives an `Oban.Job` struct as the sole argument. If no clause
  matches on `%Oban.Job{}` then the `args` are extracted and `perform/1` is called again with the
  args. This allows workers to change the behavior of `perform/1` based on attributes of the Job,
  e.g. the number of attempts or when it was inserted.

  A job is considered complete if `perform/1` returns a non-error value, and it doesn't raise an
  exception or have an unhandled exit.

  Any of these return values or error events will fail the job:

  * return `{:error, error}`
  * return `:error`
  * an unhandled exception
  * an unhandled exit or throw

  As an example of error tuple handling, this worker may return an error tuple when the value is
  less than one:

      defmodule MyApp.Workers.ErrorExample do
        use Oban.Worker

        @impl true
        def perform(%{value: value}) do
          if value > 1 do
            :ok
          else
            {:error, "invalid value given: " <> inspect(value)"}
          end
        end
      end

  ## Enqueuing Jobs

  All workers implement a `new/2` function that converts an args map into a job changeset
  suitable for inserting into the database for later execution:

      %{in_the: "business", of_doing: "business"}
      |> MyApp.Workers.Business.new()
      |> MyApp.Repo.insert()

  The worker's defaults may be overridden by passing options:

      %{vote_for: "none of the above"}
      |> MyApp.Workers.Business.new(queue: "special", max_attempts: 5)
      |> MyApp.Repo.insert()

  See `Oban.Job` for all available options.

  ## Customizing Backoff

  When jobs fail they may be retried again in the future using a backoff algorithm. By default
  the backoff is exponential with a fixed padding of 15 seconds. This may be too aggressive for
  jobs that are resource intensive or need more time between retries. To make backoff scheduling
  flexible a worker module may define a custom backoff function.

  This worker defines a backoff function that delays retries using a variant of the historic
  Resque/Sidekiq algorithm:

      defmodule MyApp.SidekiqBackoffWorker do
        use Oban.Worker

        @impl true
        def backoff(attempt) do
          :math.pow(attempt, 4) + 15 + :rand.uniform(30) * attempt
        end

        @impl true
        def perform(args) do
          :do_business
        end
      end

  Here are some alternative backoff strategies to consider:

  * **constant** — delay by a fixed number of seconds, e.g. 1→15, 2→15, 3→15
  * **linear** — delay for the same number of seconds as the current attempt, e.g. 1→1, 2→2, 3→3
  * **squared** — delay by attempt number squared, e.g. 1→1, 2→4, 3→9
  * **sidekiq** — delay by a base amount plus some jitter, e.g. 1→32, 2→61, 3→135

  scheduled for a retry.
