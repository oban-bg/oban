# Testing Config

An Oban instance's config is statically defined during initialization and it
determines the supervision tree that Oban builds. The instance config is
encapsulated by an `Oban.Config` struct, which is then referenced by plugins,
queues, and most public functions.

Your app's Oban config is extremely important and it deserves testing!

## Testing Production Config

Within the test environment, apps typically disable queues and plugins for more
control and to prevent sandbox interference. That means only a subset of the
full Oban config is verified when your application boots for testing.

The `Oban.Config.validate/1` helper is used internally when the config
initializes. Along with each top level option, like the `:engine` or `:repo`, it
recursively verifies all queue and plugin options.

You can use `validate/1` to verify the full production config:

```elixir
test "production oban config is valid" do
  config =
    "config/config.exs"
    |> Config.Reader.read!(env: :prod)
    |> get_in([:my_app, Oban])

  assert :ok = Oban.Config.validate(config)
end
```

When the configuration contains **any** invalid options, like an invalid engine,
you'll see the test fail with an error like this:

```elixir
{:error, "expected :engine to be an Oban.Queue.Engine, got: MyApp.Repo"}
```

## Testing Plugin Config

Validation is especially helpful for plugins that have complex configuration,
e.g. `Cron` or the `Dynamic*` plugins from Oban Pro. As of Oban v2.12.0 all
plugins implement the `c:Oban.Plugin.validate/1` callback and we can test them
in isolation as well as through the top level config.

If your plugins are statically defined, then validating them through
`Oban.Config` is easy and recommended. If your config is dynamic, then
you can test the plugin config directly.

Suppose you have a helper function that returns a crontab config at runtime:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Oban do
  def cron_config do
    [crontab: [{"0 24 * * *", MyApp.Worker}]]
  end
end
```

You can call that function within a test and then assert that it is valid with
`c:Oban.Plugin.validate/1`:

```elixir
test "testing cron plugin configuration" do
  config = MyApp.Oban.cron_config()

  assert :ok = Oban.Plugins.Cron.validate(config)
end
```

Running this test will return an error tuple, showing that the cron expression
isn't valid.

```elixir
{:error, %ArgumentError{message: "expression field 24 is out of range 0..23"}}
```

Switch the expression from `0 24 * * *` to `0 23 * * *`, run the tests again,
and everything passes!
