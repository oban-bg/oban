# Splitting Queues Between Nodes

Running every job queue on every node isn't always ideal. Imagine that your
application has some CPU intensive jobs that you'd prefer not to run on nodes
that serve web requests. Perhaps you start temporary nodes that are only meant
to _insert_ jobs but should never _execute_ any. Fortunately, we can control
this by configuring certain node types, or even single nodes, to **run only a
subset of queues**.

## Use Case: Isolating Video Processing Intensive Jobs

One notorious type of CPU intensive work is video processing. When our
application is transcoding multiple videos simultaneously it is a _major_ drain
on system resources and may impact response times. To avoid this we can run
dedicated worker nodes that don't serve any web requests and handle all of the
transcoding.

While it's possible to separate our system into `web` and `worker` apps within
an umbrella, that wouldn't allow us to dynamically change queues at runtime.
Let's look at an **environment variable based method** for dynamically
configuring queues at runtime.

Within `config.exs` our application is configured to run three queues:
`default`, `media` and `events`:

```elixir
config :my_app, Oban,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  queues: [default: 15, media: 10, events: 25]
```

We will use an `OBAN_QUEUES` environment variable to override the queues at
runtime. For illustration purposes the queue parsing all happens within the
application module, but it would work equally well in `releases.exs` (or `runtime.exs`).

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyApp.Repo,
      MyApp.Endpoint,
      {Oban, oban_opts()}
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor)
  end

  defp oban_opts do
    env_queues = System.get_env("OBAN_QUEUES")

    :my_app
    |> Application.get_env(Oban)
    |> Keyword.update(:queues, [], &queues(env_queues, &1))
  end

  defp queues("*", defaults), do: defaults
  defp queues(nil, defaults), do: defaults
  defp queues(_, false), do: false

  defp queues(values, _defaults) when is_binary(values) do
    values
    |> String.split(" ", trim: true)
    |> Enum.map(&String.split(&1, ",", trim: true))
    |> Keyword.new(fn [queue, limit] ->
      {String.to_existing_atom(queue), String.to_integer(limit)}
    end)
  end
end
```

The `queues` function's first three clauses ensure that we can fall back to the
queues specified in our configuration (or `false`, for testing). The fourth
clause is much more involved, and that is where the environment parsing happens.
It expects the `OBAN_QUEUES` value to be a string formatted as `queue,limit`
pairs and separated by spaces. For example, to run only the `default` and
`media` queues with a limit of 5 and 10 respectively, you would pass the string
`default,5 media,10`.

Note that the parsing clause has a couple of safety mechanisms to ensure that
only real queues are specified:

1. It automatically trims while splitting values, so extra whitespace like won't
   break parsing (i.e. ` default,3 `)
2. It only converts the `queue` string to _an existing atom_, hopefully
   preventing typos that would start a random queue (i.e. `defalt`)

### Usage Examples

In development (or when using `mix` rather than releases) we can specify the
environment variable inline:

```bash
OBAN_QUEUES="default,10 media,5" mix phx.server # default: 10, media: 5
```

We can also explicitly opt in to running all of the configured queues:

```bash
OBAN_QUEUES="*" mix phx.server # default: 15, media: 10, events: 25
```

Finally, without `OBAN_QUEUES` set at all it will implicitly fall back to the
configured queues:

```bash
mix phx.server # default: 15, media: 10, events: 25
```

## Flexible Across all Environments

This environment variable based solution is more flexible than running separate
umbrella apps because we can reconfigure at any time. In a limited environment,
like staging, we can run _all_ the queues on a single node using the exact same
code we use in production. In the future, if other workers start to utilize too
much CPU or RAM we can shift them to the worker node **without any code
changes**.
