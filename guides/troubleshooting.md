# Troubleshooting

## No Notifications with PgBouncer

Using PgBouncer's "Transaction Pooling" setup disables all of PostgreSQL's
`LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` activity. Some functionality, such as triggering job
execution, scaling queues, canceling jobs, etc. rely on those notifications.

There are several options available to ensure functional notifications:

1. Switch to the `Oban.Notifiers.PG` notifier. This alternative notifier relies
   on Distributed Erlang and exchanges messages within a cluster. The only
   drawback to the PG notifier is that it doesn't trigger job insertion events.

2. Switch `PgBouncer` to "Session Pooling". Session pooling isn't as resource
   efficient as transaction pooling, but it retains all Postgres functionality.

3. Use a dedicated Repo that connects directly to the database, bypassing
   `PgBouncer`.

If none of those options work, the [Stager][stag] will switch to `local` polling
mode to ensure that queues keep processing jobs.

## Unexpectedly Re-running All Migrations

Without a version comment on the `oban_jobs` table, it will rerun all of the
migrations. This can happen when comments are stripped when restoring from a
backup, most commonly during a transition from one database to another.

The fix is to set the latest migrated version as a comment. To start, search
through your previous migrations and find the last time you ran an Oban
migration. Once you've found the latest version, e.g. `version: 10`, then you
can set that as a comment on the `oban_jobs` table:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE public.oban_jobs IS '10'"
```

Once the comment is in place only the migrations from that version onward will
run.

## Heroku

### Elixir and Erlang Versions

If your app crashes on launch, be sure to confirm you are running the correct
version of Elixir and Erlang ([view requirements][reqs]). If using the
*hashnuke/elixir* buildpack, you can update the `elixir_buildpack.config` file
in your application's root directory to something like:

```
# Elixir version
elixir_version=1.13.0

# Erlang version
erlang_version=24.2
```

Available Erlang versions are available [here][versions].

[versions]: https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir-otp-builds/blob/master/otp-versions.

### Database Connections

Make sure that you have enough available database connections when running on
Heroku. Oban uses a database connection in order to listen for Pub/Sub
notifications. This is in addition to your Ecto Repo `pool_size` setting.

Heroku's [Hobby tier Postgres plans][plans] have a maximum of 20 connections, so
if you're using one of those plan accordingly.
