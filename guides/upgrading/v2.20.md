# Upgrading to v2.20

This Oban release includes an optional, but recommended migration.

## Bump Your Deps

Update Oban (and optionally Pro) to the latest versions:

```elixir
[
  {:oban, "~> 2.20"},
]
```

## Run Oban.Migrations for v13 (Optional)

The v13 migration adds compound indexes for `cancelled_at` and `discarded_at` columns. This is
done to improve `Oban.Plugins.Pruner` performance for cancelled and discarded jobs.

To get started, create a migration to create the table:

```bash
$ mix ecto.gen.migration upgrade_oban_jobs_to_v13
```

Within the generated migration module:

```elixir
use Ecto.Migration

def up, do: Oban.Migrations.up(version: 13)

def down, do: Oban.Migrations.down(version: 13)
```

If you have multiple Oban instances, or use an alternate prefix, you'll need to run the migration
for each prefix.
