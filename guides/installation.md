# Installation

Oban is published on [Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/oban). Add it to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:oban, "~> 2.13"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` to install Oban and its dependencies, including
[Ecto][ecto], [Jason][jason] and [Postgrex][postgrex].

After the packages are installed you must create a database migration to add the
`oban_jobs` table to your database:

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration add_oban_jobs_table
```

Open the generated migration in your editor and call the `up` and `down`
functions on `Oban.Migration`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.AddObanJobsTable do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up do
    Oban.Migration.up(version: 11)
  end

  # We specify `version: 1` in `down`, ensuring that we'll roll all the way back down if
  # necessary, regardless of which version we've migrated `up` to.
  def down do
    Oban.Migration.down(version: 1)
  end
end
```

This will run all of Oban's versioned migrations for your database. Migrations
between versions are idempotent and rarely† change after a release. As new
versions are released you may need to run additional migrations.

_† The only exception is the removal of `oban_beats`. That table is no longer
created or modified in any migrations_

Now, run the migration to create the table:

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

Before you can run an Oban instance you must provide some configuration. Set
some base configuration within `config.exs`:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :my_app, Oban,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  plugins: [Oban.Plugins.Pruner],
  queues: [default: 10]
```

To prevent Oban from running jobs and plugins during test runs, enable
`:testing` mode in `test.exs`:

```elixir
# config/test.exs
config :my_app, Oban, testing: :inline
```

Oban instances are isolated supervision trees and must be included in your
application's supervisor to run. Use the application configuration you've just
set and include Oban in the list of supervised children:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    MyApp.Repo,
    {Oban, Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, Oban)}
  ]

  Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor)
end
```

Finally, verify that Oban is configured and running properly. Within a new `iex
-S mix` session:

```elixir
iex(1)> Oban.config()
#=> %Oban.Config{repo: MyApp.Repo}
```

You're all set! Get started creating jobs and configuring queues in
[Usage][use], or head to the [testing guide][test] to learn how to test with
Oban.
